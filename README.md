# RunningBox

Class __RunningBox__ displays a pure blue, draggable box when program starts.
The "Running" box jumps to a new, randomly chosen location within the canvas every time user
clicks on it. If the user's click is outside of the box, the box's color becomes greener
until a certain point. Clicking or dragging the box results in the box reverting to it's
blue color.
